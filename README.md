The EduMix-24 and EduMath-24 datasets are specialized collections of educational resources designed for the task of automatic educational content classification.
Here are their key characteristics:

    Source: They were sourced from a real-world intelligent education platform, meaning the data is authentic and reflects modern digital learning materials.

    Composition: Together, they consist of 18,799 individual educational resources. These resources could include items like lesson plans, video lectures, interactive exercises, homework assignments, or presentation slides.

    Annotation: A crucial feature is that all resources have been manually annotated by human experts. This ensures high-quality labels for training and evaluating machine learning models.

    Classification Tasks: The resources are labeled across three distinct classification tasks:

        9 Lesson Types: Categorizing the overall structure or goal of the lesson (e.g., Practice class, Self-study class, Cooperative class).

        15 Teaching Modes: Identifying the primary instructional method used (e.g., Single-point teaching, Heuristic teaching,  Debate teaching).

        9 Activity Elements: Labeling the specific interactive components within the resource (e.g., Identify (A1), Understand (A2), Apply (A3)).

EduMix-24 and EduMath-24 Datasets is collected for Classifying Long-Content Educational Resources with Imbalanced Category Distributions. 

Specifically, EduMix-24: This dataset encompasses teaching resources for 11 subjects, including Chinese, English, Science, Information Technology, math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Geography, and Moral \& Legal Studies. The resources are divided into two tasks: lesson type classification and teaching mode classification. Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, significant variations exist in sample sizes across subtasks, reflecting the distribution typically observed in real-world educational scenarios.

EduMath-24: This dataset focuses on mathematical teaching resources for primary and middle school levels, containing extensive mathematical symbols and formulas. It includes the same resource types as EduMix-24: lesson plans, study guides, courseware, instructional videos, and test questions. Additionally, EduMath-24 features an ability elements classification subtask. The dataset's pronounced imbalance presents a valuable opportunity for research into long-text processing and the comprehension of mathematical notation.

We evaluated PERC against several strong baseline models on EduMix-24 and EduMath-24 using standard metrics, including Accuracy, F1 Score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The best-performing results for each task are highlighted in bold. These baselines include both traditional text classifiers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and specialized long-text models (e.g., BigBird, mLongT5), allowing us to comprehensively assess PERC‚Äôs effectiveness in handling long-form  educational content.
